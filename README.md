# SEED: Educational Discussions with Software Engineers

SEED is a Python 3 program that analyzes and visualizes a data set for the [SEED
Project](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham/seed/) created by [Gregory
M. Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham/). You can use this
program to download the responses of the interviewees who participated in the
SEED project. Additionally, you can use SEED to see the responses and to perform
natural language processing to extract the key topic models. This program is
currently under heavy development; more documentation is forthcoming.
