# SEED: Educational Discussions with Software Engineers

SEED is a Python 3 program that analyzes and visualizes a data set for the [SEED
Project](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham/seed/) created by [Gregory
M. Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham/). You can use this
program to download the responses of the interviewees who participated in the
SEED project. Additionally, you can use SEED to see the responses and to perform
natural language processing to extract the key topic models. This program is
currently under heavy development; more documentation is forthcoming.

## Problems or Praise

If you have any problems with installing or using SEED, then please create an
issue associated with this Git repository using the "Issues" link at the top of
this site. I will do everything that I can to resolve your issue and ensure that
the entire tool works well in your own development environment.
