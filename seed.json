Unless you are working early-on at a startup or you are working on a new project, most professional developers will be working in pre-existing code bases. These can be very large code bases where you are only working on one small part of it. You'll be expected to read other people's code regularly and add onto that code while following standards setup by the organization (or no standards which leads to headaches). As you grow as a developer and professional and gain more experience, you'll realize why you love standards!\r\n\r\nAlso, when you start a new job, you are definitely going to find there are bad programming practices being used and hacks and what not. Choose your battles. Do not go into a new company telling them how everything they have done is wrong. Do the best you can without annoying everyone at the company. Sometimes there is a reason for the way something was done. If it's that bad, get your experience points and start looking for a new job. Spend your energy learning good coding practices outside of that company instead of constantly arguing at work. Most companies can be set in their way of doing things.", "time": "20", "_format": "plain", "question_advice": "I highly recommend working on a small side project that utilizes multiple technologies to build up your understanding of professional development end to end. For example, try building a small web application which will build your knowledge on systems administration, web hosting, HTTP stack, databases, back end programming, and front-end programming. I would also make sure to take a database class if possible because of the prevalence of databases in the professional world. I didn't take a database class at Allegheny, and I regret it. It can take a little bit of time to wrap your head around relational databases and the methodology as well as the functional programming paradigm of SQL.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you can, learn GIT as soon as possible.

We build custom software for clients. As a team, we have different levels of experience in different areas, but our founder, Drew Miller (Allegheny '05), has structured the company more like partners in a law firm, as opposed to a more traditional hierarchy of positions. This does away with seniority, and gives each of us more agency and more responsibility.\r\n\r\nWe're all programmers, so we end up having to step into non-programming roles as the needs arise, such as business development, and project management. This is especially true internally, as we share responsibility in shaping the future of our company, and creating its health and prosperity.\r\n\r\nI think it's interesting the way this sort of company model enables us to be more agile as compared to the more traditional, bureaucratic model. Our small company size shelters us from a lot of the bureaucratic layers. The end result, though, is that we're able to more easily experiment as a company. We can examine ourselves, and make adjustments quickly. And we can iterate through experimental processes, refining them and working out bugs.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a new idea, of course. Paul Graham has written about this since at least 2004, and lots of non-tech companies have implemented something similar. But it's still enough of a novel idea to warrant writing about.

He did the hard work of putting the philosophies into practice, of building a company which stands as a case study and as a success story.
