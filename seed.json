For example, try building a small web application which will build your knowledge on systems administration, web hosting, HTTP stack, databases, back end programming, and front-end programming. I would also make sure to take a database class if possible because of the prevalence of databases in the professional world. I didn't take a database class at Allegheny, and I regret it. It can take a little bit of time to wrap your head around relational databases and the methodology as well as the functional programming paradigm of SQL.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you can, learn GIT as soon as possible. Learning how to use a version control system is extremely important when working professionally and the earlier you start working with it and understanding it, the better you'll be able to integrate yourself into a professional team. Companies love candidates that have a Github account setup with code to show in them.", "_subject": "Submission to the SEED Project", "question_challenge": "Keeping up with technology. You'll soon realize that after undergrad that there is always more to learn about the field and technology is always changing. You won't always use the latest and greatest technology at your job, but if you want to grow as a professional programmer, you will continue to learn.\r\n\r\nWorking on outside projects outside of working hours is a great way to experiment with new technology and to refresh your enjoyment of programming. Most professional developers may be working on a project they don't find that fulfilling on the day to day, but having a side project allows you the freedom to experiment and grow as a developer and work on something you find interesting and fulfilling.\r\n\r\nAlso, one thing I found surprising is that you do very little new development as a professional. Unless you are working early-on at a startup or you are working on a new project, most professional developers will be working in pre-existing code bases. These can be very large code bases where you are only working on one small part of it. You'll be expected to read other people's code regularly and add onto that code while following standards setup by the organization (or no standards which leads to headaches). As you grow as a developer and professional and gain more experience, you'll realize why you love standards!\r\n\r\nAlso, when you start a new job, you are definitely going to find there are bad programming practices being used and hacks and what not. Choose your battles. Do not go into a new company telling them how everything they have done is wrong. Do the best you can without annoying everyone at the company. Sometimes there is a reason for the way something was done. If it's that bad, get your experience points and start looking for a new job. Spend your energy learning good coding practices outside of that company instead of constantly arguing at work. Most companies can be set in their way of doing things."}, {"company_name": "University of Colorado Colorado Springs", "web_site": "http://cs.uccs.edu/~kjustice", "question_fact": "It is extremely exciting to teach and to work with students to build and research new software testing tools.  You never know what will happen!  In a recent research project on security in IoT, we learned the extreme need for care in experiment setup.  My student intended that hackers only attack his simulated IoT network- maybe get into other parts of the machine as well.  However, one night his home wireless printer started spewing blank pages of paper in the middle of the night.  I still think his house is haunted... but it was actually a telnet attack that escaped from his honey pot environment.

Also, learn to say no.  You can't do everything.  Remember your goals and priorities in all you do.  ", "_subject": "Submission to the SEED Project", "question_challenge": "I think the biggest challenge is in balancing teaching and research.  Research needs to be largely self motivated whereas teaching requires constant attention given firm deadlines and student needs.  Within both areas, your teaching and research constantly needs to evolve.  You need to follow the new technologies, languages, software engineering tools, etc  in addition to the research in those areas.  It can become very overwhelming.  "}]
